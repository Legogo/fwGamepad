# fwGamepad

Library meant to give some tools to have multiple controllers working without too much setup
This won't be as flexible as what unity InputSystem is doing. It's meant to have a quick&dirty setup game jam (or short projects).

## Next steps

I'm currently working on integrating this library (on my spare time) to older projects to make sure it's generic enough for everyone.

A "how to" will come when it's stable enough.
